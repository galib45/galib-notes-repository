Corneal ulcer is an *inflammatory* or *infective* condition of cornea involving **disruption of its epithelial layer** with involvement of corneal stroma. Inflammation of the cornea is called **keratitis**. Keratitis and corneal ulcer is not always synonymous. 

## Types
### [Infective](infective-corneal-ulcer)
- Bacterial
	- Gram positive
		- *Staphylococcus aureus*
		- *Streptococcus pyogenes*
		- *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
		- *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*
	- Gram negative
		- *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
		- *Neisseria gonorrheae*
		- *Neisseria meningitidis*
		- *Haemophilus influenzae*
		- *Escherichia coli*
		- *Proteus*
		- *Klebsiella*
		- *Chlamydia trachomatis*
- Fungal
	- Filamentous fungi
		- *Aspergillus fumigatus*
		- *Fusarium solani*
		- *Cephalosporium*
	- Yeasts
		- *Candida*
		- *Cryptococcus*
- Viral
	- Herpes simplex (HSV)
	- Herpes zoster (VZV)
	- Adenovirus
- Protozoal
	- *Acanthamoeba*

### Non-infective
1. Bacterial hypersensitivity mediated corneal ulcer
	- Marginal corneal ulcer
	- Phlyctenulosis
2. Peripheral corneal ulcer
	- Mooren's ulcer
	- Peripheral ulcerative keratitis
3. Neurotrophic keratopathy
4. Exposure keratopathy
5. Miscellaneous keratitis
	- Recurrent corneal epithelial erosions
	- Keratomalacia

## Risk factors
1. **Trauma to the corneal epithelium**: By injury, foreign body etc.
2. **Ocular surface diseases**
	- Herpetic keratitis
	- Bullous keratopathy
	- Dry eyes
	- Chronic dacryocystitis
	- Chronic blepharitis
3. Old age
4. Low socio-economic condition
5. Vitamin A deficiency
6. Use of local or systemic steroids
7. **Lowering of general body resistance**, e.g. malnutrition, diabetes, systemic immuno-suppressive therapy, HIV etc.

## Pathology of corneal ulcer
Uncomplicated, localized corneal ulcer has 4 stages — stages of progressive infiltration, active ulceration, regression and cicatrization.

**Stage of progressive infiltration**
- Infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils) and/or lymphocytes (in case of viral) into epithelium
- Necrosis of the involved tissue

**Stage of active ulceration**
- Necrosis & sloughing of epithelium, Bowman's membrane & the involved stroma → formation of ulcer
- Zone of infiltration → may extend to around & beneath the ulcer
- Sides & floor of the ulcer → may show grey infiltration & sloughing
- Hyperemia of circumcorneal blood vessels (*ciliary congestion*)

- Accumulation of purulent exudates on the cornea
- Some degree of iritis
- Pus collects in the anterior chamber and settles downward (*hypopyon*)

- Deeper penetration of infection → descemetocele formation & possible corneal perforation

**Stage of regression**
- induced by normal host defense mechanism, treatment augments this normal response
- a line of demarcation (consisting of leukocytes) develops around the ulcer
- phagocytosis of the offending organism → phagocytosis of the necrotic debris → digestion of the necrotic material → initial enlargement of the ulcer
- the ulcer now begins to heal & epithelium starts growing over the edge

```
* if only epithelium is involved → heals without scar
* if stroma is involved → heals with scar formation
```

**Stage of cicatrization** *(Latin cicatrix = scar)*
- Healing continues by progressive epithelialization (which forms a permanent covering)
- Beneath the epithelium, fibrous tissue is laid down.
- The fibrous tissue is derived from
	- Invading mononuclear cells
	- Keratocytes (corneal fibroblasts) and
	- Endothelial cells of the new vessels.
- Stroma thickens & fills under the epithelium
- Sometimes the gap is not filled exactly as level of surface → flattened cornea (*Corneal facets*)
- *Corneal opacity* develops due to
	- irregular arrangement of the new fibers
	- damage to the Bowman’s membrane

Scar variety|Involvement|Opacity
---|---|---
Nebula|Epithelium + Bowman's membrane + few superficial stromal lamellae|slight
Macula|(+) 1/3 of corneal stroma|little more
Leucoma|(+) > 1/3 of corneal stroma|highest
