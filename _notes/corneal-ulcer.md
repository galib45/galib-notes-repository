Corneal ulcer is an *inflammatory* or *infective* condition of cornea involving **disruption of its epithelial layer** with involvement of corneal stroma. Inflammation of the cornea is called **keratitis**. Keratitis and corneal ulcer is not always synonymous. 

## Types of keratitis
### Superficial keratitis
- **Infective**
	- Bacterial
	- Fungal
	- Viral
	- Protozoal
- **Non-infective**
	- Central
		- Exposure keratitis
		- Neurotrophic keratitis
		- Atheromatous keratitis.
	- Peripheral
		- Marginal keratitis
		- Phlyctenular keratitis
		- Mooren’s ulcer
		- Terrien’s degeneration
		- Rosacea keratitis
		- Keratitis associated with collagen diseases.

### Deep keratitis
- Interstitial keratitis
- Disciform keratitis
- Sclerosing keratitis

## Bacterial Keratitis
Intact corneal epithelium cannot be penetrated by any organism except, *Neisseria gonorrheae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*. With the other bacteria, keratitis is invariably associated with one or more of the following predisposing factors. 

### Predisposing factors
1. **Trauma to the corneal epithelium**: By injury, foreign body, trichiasis, entropion, contact lens wear, etc.
2. **Underlying corneal diseases**: Herpetic keratitis, corneal erosions, bullous keratopathy, keratomalacia, etc.
3. Neurotrophic or exposure keratopathy
4. Dry eyes
5. Chronic dacryocystitis or blepharitis
6. Use of topical steroids
7. **Lowering of general body resistance**, e.g. malnutrition, diabetes, systemic immuno-suppressive therapy, etc.

### Stages
Uncomplicated, localized corneal ulcer has 4 stages — stages of infiltration,
progression, regression and cicatrization.

### Clinical features
**Symptoms**
- Acute pain, redness and lacrimation
- Photophobia
- Decreased visual acuity
- White spot on the cornea.

**Signs**
- Marked blepharospasm
- Lid edema
- Ciliary congestion of the conjunctiva
- Ulcer usually starts as a grayish-white, circumscribed infiltration, with edema of the surrounding tissue. There is absence of window reflex. The margins of the ulcer are overhanging, and the floor is covered by necrotic material. The extent of the ulcer may be detected by fluorescein staining and seen with blue filter. Ulcer area stains as brilliant green. Later, the ulcer becomes gradually smooth in the regressive stage, and ultimately, scar tissue begins to appear the edges and the floor of the ulcer.
- Some degree of features of iritis.
- Hypopyon may be present (Fig. 13.8).
- Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be raised in presence of hypopyon. But if the ulcer perforates, IOP decreases.
