Corneal ulcer is an *inflammatory* or *infective* condition of cornea involving **disruption of its epithelial layer** with involvement of corneal stroma. Inflammation of the cornea is called **keratitis**. Keratitis and corneal ulcer is not always synonymous. 

## Types of keratitis
### Superficial keratitis
- **Infective**
	- Bacterial
	- Fungal
	- Viral
	- Protozoal
- **Non-infective**
	- Central
		- Exposure keratitis
		- Neurotrophic keratitis
		- Atheromatous keratitis.
	- Peripheral
		- Marginal keratitis
		- Phlyctenular keratitis
		- Mooren’s ulcer
		- Terrien’s degeneration
		- Rosacea keratitis
		- Keratitis associated with collagen diseases.

### Deep keratitis
- Interstitial keratitis
- Disciform keratitis
- Sclerosing keratitis

## Bacterial Keratitis
Intact corneal epithelium cannot be penetrated by any organism except, *Neisseria gonorrheae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*. With the other bacteria, keratitis is invariably associated with one or more of the following predisposing factors. 

### Predisposing factors
1. **Trauma to the corneal epithelium**: By injury, foreign body, trichiasis, entropion, contact lens wear, etc.
2. **Underlying corneal diseases**: Herpetic keratitis, corneal erosions, bullous keratopathy, keratomalacia, etc.
3. Neurotrophic or exposure keratopathy
4. Dry eyes
5. Chronic dacryocystitis or blepharitis
6. Use of topical steroids
7. **Lowering of general body resistance**, e.g. malnutrition, diabetes, systemic immuno-suppressive therapy, etc.
