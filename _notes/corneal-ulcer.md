Corneal ulcer is an *inflammatory* or *infective* condition of cornea involving **disruption of its epithelial layer** with involvement of corneal stroma. Inflammation of the cornea is called **keratitis**. Keratitis and corneal ulcer is not always synonymous.

### Deep keratitis
- Interstitial keratitis
- Disciform keratitis
- Sclerosing keratitis

## Bacterial Keratitis
Intact corneal epithelium cannot be penetrated by any organism except, *Neisseria gonorrheae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*. With the other bacteria, keratitis is invariably associated with one or more of the following predisposing factors. 

### Predisposing factors
1. **Trauma to the corneal epithelium**: By injury, foreign body, trichiasis, entropion, contact lens wear, etc.
2. **Underlying corneal diseases**: Herpetic keratitis, corneal erosions, bullous keratopathy, keratomalacia, etc.
3. Neurotrophic or exposure keratopathy
4. Dry eyes
5. Chronic dacryocystitis or blepharitis
6. Use of topical steroids
7. **Lowering of general body resistance**, e.g. malnutrition, diabetes, systemic immuno-suppressive therapy, etc.

### Stages
Uncomplicated, localized corneal ulcer has 4 stages — stages of infiltration,
progression, regression and cicatrization.

**Stage of infiltration and progression**
- *Edema and localized necrosis* of the anterior part of the corneal stroma.
- Necrotic tissue is cast off leaving a saucer shaped defect, known as *ulcer*.
- Epithelium is *sloughed off* simultaneously with an involvement of larger area.
- Dense *infiltration of polymorphs* followed by *macrophages*. This infiltration extends for some distance around the ulcer.
- There is an *associated iritis* due to toxin being absorbed into the anterior chamber.
- This reaction is so toxic that leucocytosis takes place, and polymorphs poured out of the blood vessels pass into the aqueous, and gravitate at the bottom of anterior chamber. This is *hypopyon* and this pus remains sterile, so long as the Descemet’s membrane is intact.

```
Edema and necrosis in the stroma → necrotic tissue cast of → saucer shaped defect (ulcer) → epithelium is sloughed off at the same time → infiltration of neutrophils → infiltration of macrophages → associated iritis → pus in the anterior chamber (hypopyon)
```

**Stage of regression**
- The *defect becomes larger*, as there is digestion of the necrotic tissue by the polymorphs.
- Line of demarcation appears surrounding the ulcer.
- Infiltrations at the edges and the base start to disappear, and polymorphs are replaced by mononuclear cells.
- The ulcerated area becomes smooth and relatively clear.

```
Digestion of necrotic tissue → defect becomes larger → line of demarcation appears → infiltration starts to disappear → neutrophils replaced by macrophages → ulcer becomes smooth
```

**Stage of cicatrization** *(Latin cicatrix = scar)*
- Healing of the defect occurs by formation of the fibrous tissue.
- The fibrous tissue is derived from
	- Invading mononuclear cells
	- Keratocytes and
	- Endothelial cells of the new vessels.
- *Corneal facets* → scar tissue may not fill the gap exactly as level of surface, which is then little flattened
- *Corneal opacity*
	- the new fibers are not arranged regularly
	- damage to the Bowman’s membrane
- If the corneal scar is thin, the resulting opacity is slight, it is called *nebular*. 
- If rather more dense—it is called *macular*.
- if still more dense and white—it is called *leucomatous*.

### Clinical features
**Symptoms**
- Acute pain, redness and lacrimation (PRL)
- Photophobia
- Decreased visual acuity
- White spot on the cornea.

**Signs**
1. Characteristics of the ulcer
	- Starts as a *grayish-white, circumscribed infiltration*, with edema of the surrounding tissue
	- Margins → overhanging
	- Floor → covered by necrotic material
	- Later, the ulcer becomes gradually smooth in the regressive stage, and ultimately, scar tissue begins to appear the edges and the floor of the ulcer.
2. Marked blepharospasm
3. Chemosis & Lid edema
4. Ciliary congestion
5. Some degree of features of iritis.
6. Hypopyon may be present.
7. Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be raised in presence of hypopyon. But if the ulcer perforates, IOP decreases.


### Complications
**Before perforation**
1. Ectatic cicatrix - bulging of thin, scarred cornea.
2. Anterior uveitis
3. Secondary glaucoma
4. Descemetocele - herniation of the Descemet’s membrane through the ulcer as a *transparent vesicle*.
5. Iridocyclitis
6. Endophthalmitis

**After perforation**
1. Corneal scaring
2. Anterior synechia
3. Adherent leukoma
4. Iris prolapse
5. Anterior staphyloma: large perforation → total prolapse of the iris → scar formation → whole thing bulges out
7. Complicated cataract
8. Panophthalmitis
9. Phthisis bulbi: large perforation → extrusion of the contents of the eyeball → shrinkage of the globe & reduction of IOP
10.  Subluxation or dislocation of the lens
11.  Corneal fistula (due to repeated perforations)

## Fungal Keratitis

### Predisposing factors
Same as bacterial keratitis

### Clinical features

**Symptoms**

Same as for the bacterial ulcer, but the symptoms are less prominent than an equal-size bacterial ulcer.

**Signs**
- Dry looking, yellowish-white lesion with indistinct margin.
- Filamentous fungus keratitis has delicate, feathery, finger-like projection into the adjacent stroma. ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605201647.png)
- It may be surrounded by grayish-halo and mutiple satellite lesions. Sometimes, it may be ring-shaped. ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605202020.png)
- Candida keratitis → typically appears as collar-button abscess without any feathery edge. ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605202153.png)
- The overlying epithelium is elevated and may be intact.
- Some degree of iridocyclitis and *massive dense hypopyon* are common. This hypopyon is *immobile* with upper convex border. 

## Investigations
Sample - corneal scraping
1. Wet film preparation with 10% KOH → fungal hyphae
2. Gram stain → Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, *Candida*
3. 4. Acid-fast stain → *Mycobacterium*
5. Calcofluor white stain → *Acanthamoeba*
6. Giemsa stain
7. Culture and sensitivity
	- Blood agar → most bacteria
	- Chocolate agar → *Haemophilus*, *Neisseria*, *Moraxella*
	- Lowenstein Jensen → *Mycobacterium*
	- SDA → fungi
8. Corneal biopsy → in complex cases
9. Confocal microscopy → for localizing and identifying the presence of filamentary fungal elements in the corneal stroma
