Intact corneal epithelium cannot be penetrated by any organism except, *Neisseria gonorrheae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*. With the other bacteria, keratitis is invariably associated with one or more of the following predisposing factors. 

### Clinical features
**Symptoms**
- Acute pain, redness and lacrimation (PRL)
- Photophobia, blurred vision
- Decreased visual acuity
- Purulent or mucopurulent discharge

**Signs**
1. An epithelial defect with large infiltrate
2. The ulcer is grayish yellow
3. Ciliary congestion
4. Chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva) & eyelid swelling
5. Severe ulceration may lead to descemetocoele formation and perforation, particularly in Pseudomonas infection
6. Some degree of features of iritis.
7. Hypopyon may be present.
8. Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be raised in presence of hypopyon. But if the ulcer perforates, IOP decreases.


### Complications
#### Before perforation
1. Anterior uveitis
2. Secondary glaucoma
3. Descemetocele - herniation of the Descemet’s membrane through the ulcer as a *transparent vesicle*.
4. Iridocyclitis
5. Endophthalmitis

#### After perforation
1. Corneal scaring
2. Anterior synechia
3. Iris prolapse ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605184511.png)
4. Anterior staphyloma: large perforation → total prolapse of the iris → scar formation → whole thing bulges out ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605184649.png)
5. Phthisis bulbi: large perforation → extrusion of the contents of the eyeball → shrinkage of the globe & reduction of IOP ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605184921.png)
6. Complicated cataract
7. Panophthalmitis
8. Subluxation or dislocation of the lens
9. Corneal fistula (due to repeated perforations)

### Investigations
#### Sample
- Corneal scraping
	- A non-preserved topical anaesthetic is instilled (preservatives may lower bacterial viability for culture)
	- Loose mucus and necrotic tissue should be removed from the surface of the ulcer prior to scraping.
	- The margins and base of the lesion are scraped.
	- Scrapings are taken with any one of the following
		- a disposable scalpel blade (e.g. No. 11 or Bard Parker)
		- the bent tip of a larger diameter hypodermic needle (e.g. 20- or 21-gauge)
		- a sterile spatula (e.g. Kimura).

- Conjunctival swabs
- Contact lenses, their cases & bottles of solutions

#### Staining
- Gram stain → Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, *Candida*
- Acid-fast stain → *Mycobacterium*
- Giemsa stain

#### Culture
- Blood agar → most bacteria
- Chocolate agar → *Haemophilus*, *Neisseria*, *Moraxella*
- Lowenstein Jensen → *Mycobacterium*

### Treatment
#### General measures
- Hospital admission
	- patients who are not likely to comply 
	- patients unable to self-administer treatment
	- aggressive disease, particularly if involving an only eye.
- Discontinuation of contact lens wear is mandatory.
- For small infiltrates that are clinically sterile
	- lower-frequency topical antibiotic and/or steroid
	- temporary cessation of contact lens wear
- Empirical broad-spectrum treatment is usually initiated before microscopy results are available.

#### Local therapy
- Antibiotics
	- Monotherapy 
		- Fluroquinolones → Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, Gatifloxacin, Gemifloxacin
	- Duotherapy
		- Combination of 2 fortified antibiotics (a cephalosporin + an aminoglycoside)
- Subconjunctival antibiotics
	- Only indicated if there is poor compliance with topical treatment.
- Mydriatics
	- Cyclopentolate 1%, Homatropine 2%, Atropine 1%
	- ciliary muscle paralysis → prevent spasm → reduce pain
	- prevent formation of posterior synechia
- Steroids
	- reduce host infmammation, improve comfort and minimize corneal scarring
	- promote replication of some microorganisms, particularly fungi, herpes simplex and mycobacteria
	- contraindicated if a fungal or mycobacterial agent is suspected


#### Systemic antibiotics
- Potential for systemic involvement
	- *N. meningitidis* → IM Benzylpenicillin, Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime or Oral Ciprofloxacin.
	- *N. gonorrhoeae* → 3rd generation Cephalosporin *e.g.* Ceftriaxone.
	- *H. influenzae* → Oral Amoxicillin & Clavulanic acid
- Resistant to conventional topical antibiotics
- Severe corneal thinning (with threatened or actual perforation)
	- Ciprofloxacin for its antibacterial activity.
	- A tetracycline (e.g. doxycycline 100 mg twice daily) for its anticollagenase effect.
- Scleral involvement
- Suspected endophthalmitis

#### Surgery
Therapeutic keratoplasty

### Fortified antibiotics
**Cephalosporin** (Cefazoline, Cefuroxime, Ceftazidime)

Preparation|500mg parenteral antibiotic is diluted with 2.5ml sterile water and added to 7.5ml of preservative free artificial tear
Concentration|50mg/ml (5%)
Shelf life |24 hours at room temperature, at least 4 days if refrigerated

**Aminoglycoside** (Gentamicin)

Preparation|2ml parenteral antibiotics (40mg/ml) is added to 5ml commercially available gentamicin ophthalmic solution (0.3%)
Concentration|15mg/ml (1.5%)
Shelf life|upto 14 days if refrigerated

#### Disadvantages of fortified antibiotics
- High cost
- Limited availability
- Contamination risk
- Short shelf life
- Need refigeration
