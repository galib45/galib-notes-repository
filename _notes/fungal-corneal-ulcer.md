## Clinical features

**Symptoms**
- Gradual onset of pain, grittiness, photophobia, blurred vision
- Watery or mucopurulent discharge

**Signs**
- Ciliary congestion
- The ulcer is usually small, cheesy, dry with indistinct margin.
- Infiltrate
	- Candida keratitis 
		- Yellow–white densely suppurative infiltrate
	- Filamentous keratitis
		- Grey or yellow–white stromal infiltrate with indistinct fluffy margins
		- Progressive infiltration, often with satellite lesions

		- Feathery branch-like extensions or a ring-shaped infiltrate may develop

		- Rapid progression with necrosis and thinning can occur.
		- Penetration of an intact Descemet membrane may occur and lead to *endophthalmitis* without evident perforation.
- Epithelial defect → not always present, sometimes small when present
- Other features
	- anterior uveitis
	- hypopyon (massive, dense & immovabele)
	- endothelial plaque
	- raised IOP
	- scleritis
	- sterile or infective endophthalmitis.

## Bacterial vs Fungal

Traits|Bacterial|Fungal
---|---|---
Onset|rapid|gradual
Symptoms|more|less
Ulcer margin|clean-cut|irregular
Satellite lesion|absent|present
Infiltrate|single & enlarging|multiple feathary/finger-like projections or ring infiltrate
Hypopyon|thinner, watery, movable, margin flat|thicker, dense, immovable, margin concave
Discharge|purulent or mucopurulent|watery or mucopurulent

## Investigations
#### Sample
Corneal scraping (from the base of the ulcer)

#### Staining
- Wet film preparation with potassium hydroxide (KOH) with direct microscopic evaluation.
- Gram and Giemsa staining.
- Other stains include periodic acid–Schiff, calcofmuor white and methenamine silver.

#### Culture
In SDA media & blood agar media

#### PCR analysis
- rapid and highly sensitive (up to 90%)
- may be the current investigation of choice

#### Corneal biopsy
- In suspected fungal keratitis 
- In the absence of clinical improvement after 3–4 days and 
- If no growth develops from scrapings after a week

#### Others
- Anterior chamber tap
- Confocal microscopy

## Treatment
#### General measures
 - Hospital admission
- Discontinuation of contact lens wear
- Dark glass

#### Removal of epithelium over the lesion 
This enhances the penetration of antifungal agents. Regular removal of mucus & necrotic tissue with a spatula is also helpful.

#### Topical therapy
- Initially given hourly for 48 hours, then reduced
- At least for 12 weeks because most anti-fungal are fungistatic.

Organism|Drug of choice|Alternatives
---|---|---
Candida|amphotericin B 0.15% or econazole 1%|natamycin 5%, fluconazole 2%, clotrimazole 1% and voriconazole 1 or 2%
Filamentous fungi|natamycin 5% or econazole 1%|amphotericin B 0.15%, miconazole 1% and voriconazole 1 or 2%

- A broad spectrum antibiotic → to prevent bacterial co-infection.
- Cycloplegics → to relieve pain.

#### Sub-conjunctival Fluconazole
May be used in severe cases.

#### Systemic antifungals 
- In severe cases.
- When lesions are near the limbus.
- When resistance to topical antifungals.
- Scleral involvement.
- Suspected endophthalmitis.
- Options → Voriconazole, Itraconazole, Fluconazole

#### Tetracycline (e.g. doxycycline 100 mg twice daily) 
May be given for its anticollagenase effect when there is significant thinning.

#### Surgery
- Superficial Keratectomy
- Therapeutic Keratoplasty (when medical therapy is ineffective or following perforation).
