## Bacterial Corneal Ulcer
Intact corneal epithelium cannot be penetrated by any organism except, *Neisseria gonorrheae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*. With the other bacteria, keratitis is invariably associated with one or more of the following predisposing factors. 

### Clinical features
**Symptoms**
- Acute pain, redness and lacrimation (PRL)
- Photophobia, blurred vision
- Decreased visual acuity
- Purulent or mucopurulent discharge

**Signs**
1. An epithelial defect with large infiltrate
2. The ulcer is grayish yellow
3. Ciliary congestion
4. Chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva) & eyelid swelling
5. Some degree of features of iritis.
6. Hypopyon may be present.
7. Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be raised in presence of hypopyon. But if the ulcer perforates, IOP decreases.


### Complications
**Before perforation**
1. Anterior uveitis
2. Secondary glaucoma
3. Descemetocele - herniation of the Descemet’s membrane through the ulcer as a *transparent vesicle*.
4. Iridocyclitis
5. Endophthalmitis

**After perforation**
1. Corneal scaring
2. Anterior synechia
3. Iris prolapse
4. Anterior staphyloma: large perforation → total prolapse of the iris → scar formation → whole thing bulges out
5. Complicated cataract
6. Panophthalmitis
7. Phthisis bulbi: large perforation → extrusion of the contents of the eyeball → shrinkage of the globe & reduction of IOP
8. Subluxation or dislocation of the lens
9. Corneal fistula (due to repeated perforations)

## Fungal Corneal Ulcer

### Clinical features

**Symptoms**
- Gradual onset of pain, grittiness, photophobia, blurred vision
- Watery or mucopurulent discharge

**Signs**
- Dry looking, yellowish-white lesion with indistinct margin.
- Filamentous fungus keratitis has delicate, feathery, finger-like projection into the adjacent stroma. ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605201647.png)
- It may be surrounded by grayish-halo and mutiple satellite lesions. Sometimes, it may be ring-shaped. ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605202020.png)
- Candida keratitis → typically appears as collar-button abscess without any feathery edge. ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020210605202153.png)
- The overlying epithelium is elevated and may be intact.
- Some degree of iridocyclitis and *massive dense hypopyon* are common. This hypopyon is *immobile* with upper convex border. 

## Bacterial vs Fungal

Traits|Bacterial|Fungal
---|---|---
Onset|rapid|gradual
Symptoms|more|less
Ulcer margin|clean-cut|irregular
Satellite lesion|absent|present
Infiltrate|single & enlarging|multiple feathary/finger-like projections or ring infiltrate
Hypopyon|thinner, watery, movable, margin flat|thicker, dense, immovable, margin concave
Discharge|purulent or mucopurulent|watery or mucopurulent


## Investigations
Sample - corneal scraping
1. Wet film preparation with 10% KOH → fungal hyphae
2. Gram stain → Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, *Candida*
3. Acid-fast stain → *Mycobacterium*
5. Calcofluor white stain → *Acanthamoeba*
6. Giemsa stain
7. Culture and sensitivity
	- Blood agar → most bacteria
	- Chocolate agar → *Haemophilus*, *Neisseria*, *Moraxella*
	- Lowenstein Jensen → *Mycobacterium*
	- SDA → fungi
8. Corneal biopsy → in complex cases
9. Confocal microscopy → for localizing and identifying the presence of filamentary fungal elements in the corneal stroma

## Treatment

### Bacterial Keratitis
1. Hospital admission
2. Discontinuation of contact lens use
3. Empirical broad spectrum antibiotics (before microscopy results are available)
4. Local therapy
	- Antibiotics
		- Monotherapy 
			- Fluroquinolones → Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, Gatifloxacin, Gemifloxacin
		- Duotherapy
			- Combination of 2 fortified antibiotics (a cephalosporin + an aminoglycoside)
			- **Cephalosporin**
				- Ceftaroline, Cefuroxime, Ceftazidime
				- 500mg parenteral antibiotic is diluted with 2.5ml sterile water and added to 7.5ml of preservative free artificial tear
				- Concentration → 50mg/ml (5%)
				- Shelf life → 24 hours at room temperature, at least 4 days if refrigerated
			- **Aminoglycoside**
				- Gentamicin
				- 2ml parenteral antibiotics (40mg/ml) is added to 5ml commercially available gentamicin ophthalmic solution (0.3%)
				- Concentration → 15mg/ml (1.5%)
				- Shelf life → upto 14 days if refrigerated
	- Mydriatics
		- Cyclopentolate 1%, Homatropine 2%, Atropine 1%
		- ciliary muscle paralysis → prevent spasm → reduce pain
		- prevent formation of posterior synechia
5. Systemic antibiotics
	- Potential for systemic involvement
		- *N. meningitidis* → IM Benzylpenicillin, Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime or Oral Ciprofloxacin.
		- *N. gonorrhoeae* → 3rd generation Cephalosporin *e.g.* Ceftriaxone.
		- *H. influenzae* → Oral Amoxicillin & Clavulanic acid
	- Resistant to conventional topical antibiotics
	- Severe corneal thinning (with threatened or actual perforation)
	- Scleral involvement
	- Suspected endophthalmitis
6. Surgery - therapeutic keratoplasty

### Fungal Keratitis
 - General measures
	 - Hospital admission
	 - Removal of epithelium over the lesion (for better penetration)
	 - Dark glass
	 - Decontamination of contact lens
- Topical therapy
	- At least for 12 weeks because most anti-fungal are fungistatic.
	- *Candida* → Natamycin 5%, Clotrimazole 1%, Fluconazole 2%.
	- Filamentous fungi → Natamycin 5%, Econazole 1%, Amphotericin B 0.15%, Miconazole 1%.
	- A broad spectrum antibiotic → to prevent secondary bacterial infection.
	- Cycloplegic → relieves pain.
- Sub-conjunctival Fluconazole → in severe cases.
- Systemic antifungals 
	- In severe cases.
	- When resistance to topical antifungals.
	- When lesions are near the limbus.
	- Scleral involvement.
	- Suspected endophthalmitis.
	- Options → Voriconazole, Itraconazole, Fluconazole
- Surgery
	- Superficial Keratectomy
	- Therapeutic Keratoplasty (when medical therapy is ineffective or following perforation).
